<p><span  >Customers shall receive assurance that data relating to the content of business relationships (e.g. account and payment data) is in principle deemed confidential.&nbsp;</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >Our site&nbsp;</span><span  >also&nbsp;</span><span  >has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. Each time you modify or access your account information, we offer you the use of a secure server. Once your information is in our possession, we adhere to strict security guidelines, protecting it from unauthorized access. However, please keep in mind that we cannot guarantee that the Internet itself is 100% secure and therefore cannot take responsibility for illegal acts of hackers as long as we have taken the necessary precautions. While we do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our services is at your own risk. You should only access our site or our services through and in a secure environment. Most importantly, you are responsible for keeping your username and password secure, and you should not disclose them to anyone.&nbsp;</span> </p>

<p><span  >When using the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >app, the following duties of care, in particular, must be observed:</span> </p>
<p><span  >Customers must protect their&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >account&nbsp;</span><span  >against unauthorized use or manipulation (e.g. by locking the device or display).</span> </p>
<p><span  >&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><span  >The code for the use of the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app, especially for the topping up and releasing of credit and the confirmation of payments above a certain amount, as well as the codes for the device and display locking functions, must be kept secret and must not be disclosed to other individuals under any circumstances or stored together with the smartphone.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >The selected code may not be made up of easily ascertainable combinations (mobile number, date of birth, etc.).</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Should damages be suffered, customers must, to the best of their knowledge, contribute to clarifying the case in question and mitigating the damage. In the event of criminal acts, customers must file a complaint to the</span><span  >&nbsp;relevant statutory authority</span><span  >.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Upon installing the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app on their smartphone, customers shall confirm that they are the legitimate and authorized user of the smartphone number. Customers shall be deemed responsible for the use of their smartphone. They shall bear all consequences that arise from the use of the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat&nbsp;</span><span  >app on their smartphone.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Should there be reason to assume that unauthorized individuals have gained access to the codes for the device and display locking functions, these must be changed immediately.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >If the smartphone is lost, and especially in the case of theft,&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >must be informed promptly so that the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat&nbsp;</span><span  >app can be blocked.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Jail breaking (the deactivation of the smartphone’s security structures for the installation of applications that are not officially available) and the setting up of root access (establishment of access at the system level of the smartphone) are forbidden, as is the installation of unauthorized apps, as these make the smartphone more prone to viruses and malware.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Customers shall be required to check executed payments. Should Customers identify discrepancies, they must immediately inform&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;by phone and provide written notification no later than thirty (30) days (postmark date) after the payment date. If customers are requested to submit a damage notification/complaint form, this must be completed and signed within ten (10) days (postmark date) of the request being made and returned to</span><span  >&nbsp;Waya PayChat</span><span  >.</span> </p>

<p><span  >2.2. Topping up, releasing and processing of credit</span> </p>
<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit shall be topped up by customers via the options designated for this purpose in the app or via the SMS/text message solution. Depending on the selected top-up option, use of the payment function (see section 2.4) and the topping up of credit can coincide. However, such instances shall involve two transactions, with it first always being necessary to top up the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit before making a subsequent payment. Any transaction fees or other charges associated with the topping up of credit must be borne by the customer in question.</span> </p>
<p><span  >No interest shall be paid on&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Customers shall only be able to make payments using&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit if they have a positive balance.</span> </p>
<p><span  >In cases in which a direct debit (LSV) is set up, customers shall issue&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;with authorization to disclose certain data to third parties for the purpose of a credit rating check.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >2.3. Reference account</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >For regulatory reasons, released&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit must be transferred to a reference account. The reference account must be held in the name of the customer with a bank licensed in Nigeria.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >2.4. Payment function</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >Customers can make cashless payments using their smartphone and the associated&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit at appropriately equipped shop cash registers (at points of sale – POS), vending machines, online, in other apps by saving&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;as a payment method with selected merchants and to other customers in accordance with the applicable limits.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Upon making a payment using&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit, the relevant payment amount shall be deducted directly from the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit. Customers shall acknowledge all payments booked to the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit that have been executed in connection with their smartphone and in keeping with the following security levels. In the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app settings, customers shall be free to choose the amounts from which payments should be made a) automatically or b) after they have provided express confirmation (“OK” button). Customers can adjust the limits proposed and saved accordingly by&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >. Settings that have been made can be changed at any time. This does not apply to payments made with merchants for which customers have saved&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;as a payment method and where they have issued general payment approval (irrespective of the purchase amount). In such cases, the payment is executed automatically in accordance with the process defined by the merchant in question.</span> </p>
<p><span  >In the case of P2P payments, the mobile number may also be used to find the other customer. Provided that customers have issued the relevant access approval,&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall be authorized to access existing contacts in the payer’s smartphone in connection with such payments.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Upon saving&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;as a payment method, customers shall authorize the merchant in question to debit the relevant amount directly from their&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit without them being required to authorize individual charges. To save&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;as a payment method, customers must register with the relevant merchant. Authorization of this kind granted to a merchant can be revoked by the customer in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app at any time.

<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;may present coupons, stamps cards and other campaigns (hereinafter referred to as “campaigns”) to customers in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app where they can be seen, managed and redeemed. Here, a differentiation is made between the following campaign types:</span> </p>

These campaigns can thus be presented to all customers.</span> </li>
</ul>
 
<p><b><span  >3.1.2. Period of validity of campaigns</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >The validity of campaigns shall be as displayed in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app on the smartphone or phone screen.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Certain campaigns must be activated in advance by customers in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app before the relevant offers can be redeemed. Such cases shall be noted accordingly as part of&nbsp;</span><span  >the respective campaign. Activated campaigns may be deactivated by&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;if the associated offers are not redeemed within 10 days.</span> </p>
<p><span  >It shall be possible for customers to redeem other campaign offers without activating them in advance in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app. Many campaigns can only be redeemed upon making payments with the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >The activation of a campaign or the receipt of a campaign offer that can be redeemed without activation shall not always mean that customers are entitled to make use of a discount or non-cash benefit, as the number of redemptions may be limited by the involved third party provider. Such cases shall be noted accordingly as part of the respective campaign.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >In most cases, campaigns shall be redeemed automatically upon customers making a payment with the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app without them being required to do anything. In some instances, however, customers may be required to present a campaign to the business customer in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app or enter the campaign themselves at a terminal or in an online shop. Such cases shall be noted accordingly as part of the respective campaign.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Upon the redemption of a campaign offer with a discount, the discount shall either be deducted directly from the amount to be paid or reimbursed to customers after the payment is made in the form of a cash back credit.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >3.1.3. Sharing of campaigns</span></b> </p>

<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall also be authorized to remove saved customer loyalty cards from the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app if a customer loyalty card expires or the customer loyalty card in question is generally no longer available to be saved in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Customers shall acknowledge that the benefits associated with the use of certain customer loyalty cards shall be presented directly in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app in the form of campaigns. Customers shall only receive such campaigns if they have provided their prior consent for the presentation of third party offers (see section 3.1.1).</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >3.3. Other&nbsp;</span></b><b><span  >value-added</span></b><b><span  >services</span></b> </p>

<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall have no influence on the fulfillment of services offered by third party providers.&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall also accept no liability for campaigns that cannot be redeemed with third party providers or for discounts or benefits that are not granted in connection with the saving of customer loyalty cards. Such cases may include the failure to&nbsp;</span><span  >grant employee discounts or instances in which loyalty points remain outstanding, are lost or disappear.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall endeavour to ensure the uninterrupted availability and fault-free usability of&nbsp;</span><span  >value-added</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >services in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app.&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;cannot, however, guarantee this at all times.

<p><b><span  >4.2. Requirements for the use of the&nbsp;</span></b><b><span  >Waya PayChat</span></b><b><span  >&nbsp;app</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >To enable&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;to process customer payments and provide&nbsp;</span><span  >value-added</span><span  >&nbsp;</span><span  >services, customers must save the following master data in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app upon registering: smartphone number, name, place of residence, nationality, date of birth and e-mail address.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >4.3. Making payments with the&nbsp;</span></b><b><span  >Waya PayChat</span></b><b><span  >&nbsp;app</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >Should a customer wish to initiate a payment via the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app at a point of sale (hereinafter referred to as a “POS”) of a business customer, a connection shall be established in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system between the customer’s&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app and the relevant business customer.</span> </p>
<p><span  >The specific way in which the connection is established between the POS and&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app shall differ depending on the type of POS.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Shop cash register using a&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;terminal (technical installation at the POS that facilitates the establishment of a connection and the exchange of data between the customer’s smartphone and the POS);</span> </p>
<p><span  >Entry of a code displayed at the POS or scanning of a QR code;</span> </p>
<p><span  >Internet: by entering a code displayed in the online shop or scanning a QR code;</span> </p>
<p><span  >Automatic establishment of a connection for recurring&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;payments made by customers registered in an online shop. This arrangement is set up at the initiative of the customer;</span> </p>
<p><span  >In an app: automatic establishment of a connection at the initiative of the customer;</span> </p>
<p><span  >At vending machines: same as at shop cash registers and online.</span> </p>
<p><span  >The POS informs the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system what amount should be charged. The&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system then sends a payment request to the customer’s&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app. In the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app settings, customers shall be free to choose the amounts from which&nbsp;</span><span  >payments should be made a) automatically, b) after they have provided express confirmation (“OK” button) or c) following the entry of the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;PIN (see section 2.4).</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Upon the payment being approved by the customer, the specific amount shall be debited from the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;credit. At the time at which the amount is debited, no connection shall be established with a bank or postal account, even if customers have saved a reference account in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app.</span> </p>
<p><span  >The total purchase amount, the time of the purchase and the location of the POS at which the payment was made shall be recorded by&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >. The&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system shall generate a credit in favour of the business customer and the funds shall be transferred to the business customer’s account.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall not receive any details of the goods purchased unless the transfer of such data is governed in accordance with section 4.4.</span> </p>
<p><span  >Without the express consent of customers,&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall not disclose any personal data to the involved business customers and/or third parties unless the transfer of such data is governed in accordance with section 4.4 or 4.5.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >4.4. Saving of customer loyalty cards</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >Customers shall have the option to save or activate physical and purely digital customer loyalty cards of various business customers directly in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app. Should customers wish to do so, they must establish the necessary settings and make the required entries. Upon saving or activating a customer loyalty card in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app, customers shall be deemed to have provided their express consent to the use of the card in question. These cards shall subsequently be automatically taken into account during payment procedures performed with the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app, provided this has been made technically possible by the respective customer loyalty card issuer. Customers can deactivate the use of the customer loyalty card in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app at any time.</span> </p>
<p><span  >In such cases, the payment procedure shall also be based on section 4.3.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >If a customer loyalty card is saved in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app and a payment is made using the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;app resulting in a customer gaining a possible benefit from the use of the customer loyalty card (points, discount, etc.), the issuer of the customer loyalty card or a third party legally working on its behalf shall be provided with the same data as it would receive had the customer presented the customer loyalty card physically.</span> </p>
 
<p><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall transmit the identification number of the customer loyalty card to the business customer or its affiliated third party and, depending on the customer loyalty card used in the specific instance, also the basic payment data, including the time stamp, amount and any discounts or points granted in connection with the use of the customer loyalty card. The use of this data by the business customer involved in the specific case shall be governed exclusively by the contractual relationship between the customer and the business customer or between the customer and the third party affiliated to the business customer. The</span> </p>
<p><span  >business customer shall be responsible for ensuring the contractually compliant handling of customer data and for obtaining the required authorizations.</span> </p>
 
<p><b><span  >4.5. Redemption of mobile marketing campaign offers</span></b> </p>
<p><span  >In order to allow for the automatic redemption of campaign offers for the granting of a discount or non- cash benefit, data must be exchanged between the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system and the business customer.</span> </p>
<p><span  >The data transmitted shall depend on the system in which the campaign offer is redeemed and the discount or non-cash benefit is applied.</span> </p>
<p><span  >In cases in which campaign offers are redeemed in the system of the business customer,&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;shall transmit the campaign identification number to the business customer. The business customer shall then apply any discount or non-cash benefit for the customer. Here, the business customer shall receive the same information that it would have received had the customer presented the campaign identification number (e.g. in the form of a bar code).</span> </p>
<p><span  >If campaign offers are redeemed in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system, the discount or non-cash benefit shall be applied in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system and communicated to the business customer so that it can apply the benefit in its own system (e.g. deduction of a discount).</span> </p>
<p><span  >The contractual relationship between the business customer and the customer alone shall determine whether the business customer provides further data to&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;(e.g. information for the redemption of campaign offers that had previously been transmitted from the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system to the business customer or details of purchased goods on the basis of which campaign offers can be redeemed in the&nbsp;</span><span  >Waya PayChat</span><span  >&nbsp;system). The business customer shall be responsible for ensuring the contractually compliant handling of customer data and for obtaining the required authorizations.</span> </p>
